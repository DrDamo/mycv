	<p>The Kings Norton Surgery, Birmingham<p>

	<p>The Kings Norton Surgery is a fairly small practice serving 3800 patients.  Serving the ‘Three Estates’ meant there was a lot of social deprivation with the consequent medical and social problems to deal with.  The practice also served an older population so there was a lot of chronic disease management.</p>

<ul>

	<h2>SPECIAL INTEREST - INTERNATIONAL HEALTH</h2>

	<p>I have been increasingly involved in the field of international health over the past six years.  I envisage becoming more involved in this field of medicine in the coming years although wish to keep my base in general practice.</P>

	<p>I have gained experience in this field in the following ways</p>
<ul>
	<li>Medical Elective in Thailand (leprosy hospital and tribal clinic)</li>
	<li>5 months working in a rural hospital in Papua New Guinea</li>
	<li>Medical trips to Iraq and Myanmar</li>
	<li>Giving travel advice in General Practice</li>
	<li>Speaking at Northern Ireland Travel Medicine Conference</li> 
	<li>Studying for MSc in International Travel and Health</li>
</ul>

	<p>This range of activities means I have both theoretical and practical experience of travel medicine and international health.  I have studied malaria, TB and typhoid but also seen and treated them in real situations.  I have also had to learn to deal with cross cultural differences and language barriers in a medical and social context.</p>
