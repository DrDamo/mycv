Salaried GP	•	The Kings Norton Surgery, Birmingham

The Kings Norton Surgery is a fairly small practice serving 3800 patients.  Serving the ‘Three Estates’ meant there was a lot of social deprivation with the consequent medical and social problems to deal with.  The practice also served an older population so there was a lot of chronic disease management.

During this 4 year post I was involved in the following all of the usual clinical activities as well as some of the administrative work.  I was also involved in the following areas

•	Minor Surgery and Joint Injections
•	Managing Drug Addiction (with Drug Solutions Birmingham)
•	Teaching Year 2 Medical Students (Firm 1)
•	Designing and implementing CKD protocols
•	Converting practice from Lloyd George notes to paperlight
•	Implementation of Choose and Book at the practice

SPECIAL INTEREST – INTERNATIONAL HEALTH

I have been increasingly involved in the field of international health over the past six years.  I envisage becoming more involved in this field of medicine in the coming years although wish to keep my base in general practice.

I have gained experience in this field in the following ways

•	Medical Elective in Thailand (leprosy hospital and tribal clinic)
•	5 months working in a rural hospital in Papua New Guinea
•	Medical trips to Iraq and Myanmar
•	Giving travel advice in General Practice
•	Speaking at Northern Ireland Travel Medicine Conference 
•	Studying for MSc in International Travel and Health
•	Working with medeserve  
o	Medical advice by email for workers abroad
•	Member of the British Travel Health Association (BTHA)
•	Co-opted to the Executive Committee of the BTHA (Deputy Honorary Treasurer) 

This range of activities means I have both theoretical and practical experience of travel medicine and international health.  I have studied malaria, TB and typhoid but also seen and treated them in real situations.  I have also had to learn to deal with cross cultural differences and language barriers in a medical and social context..
